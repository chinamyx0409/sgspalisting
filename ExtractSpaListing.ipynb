      "Spa Client Comment: After my overseas trip , I was very tired and exhausted. I found this almond spa near my home.. Called and made 2 hour appointment and they assigned Ruby. Registration was smooth, walked into the room, very quiet and calm. The ambience was good. HAd a quick shower and got ready for massage. When I walked out of the room, I came out with a feeling of less 10 year old. Thanks to Ruby. She told me she was a trained acupunture therapist in china. So she rightly put right pressure on the acupoints. while massaging she explained the importance of the various points , and I was totally shocked with her vast knowledge. The prices also were not expensive. Very reasonable.\n",

Was initially skeptical as Baby looks so youthful, wondering if she is up to the task. Fortunately, she was able to provide a good hard massage that did unlock some of the stubborn knots which i have had for weeks. Great recommendation by the boss and the ladies here so far are of pretty good quality, offering skilful massages. Thank you and will be visiting again soon!\n",

Admiring her good looks and listening to her nice voice, time flies by each time for me while I enjoy the session and her company thoroughly. She does the hair removal meticulously before using her state-of-the-art laser treatment. I cannot imagine anyone else putting in the same level of care and effort. The level of service is simply unparalleled!The treatment slows down hair growth and even improve skin texture. Although prices are not cheap, I find that they are reasonable. They can be set according to the extent of hair removal required. Results can be seen after first session. Regular sessions recommended for maintenance and best results! Will continue to support her for sure.\n",

Miyuki totally changed my perception. She does the hair removal with her trademarked care, patience and tenderness, making me feel like a VIP. 👍👍👍The session was painless, extremely relaxing and therapeutic. I can see results after the first session – armpit hair was gone for good! 🤭The hair removal services are customizable – customers can choose which area or areas to focus on, and will be charged accordingly. I have gone for 4-5 sessions since and thoroughly enjoyed every session.\n",

      "Spa Client: Daisuke\n",
      "Spa Client Comment: Flew to many countries and tried a lot of Juagen masters. Miyuki san is the best one in my opinion. Her Thai and Chinese treatment can reach depths of the body, not only the waist and kidneys, sometimes the heart, chest, head and feet have an indescribable feeling of Qi and blood rushing up. Every time after I have finished treatment, I went home and slept well. I introduced to many friends, each of whom said it was good, calling her skill “a miracle of rejuvenation” and regard her as “a man’s savior”. I hope she stays in Singapore or goes to Japan, she is the chosen one for me.\n",
